# 🌧️ Rainy War Day  
_A Living Diary of Debugging, Fixes & Engineering Battles_

> “Production is war. This is my logbook.”

Welcome to my personal collection of technical challenges, production issues, and deep-dive investigations that I’ve encountered over the years — especially in networking, embedded systems, secure communications, and Linux internals.  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Due to IP restrictions, this repo contains **no proprietary company source code** (unless it's open source).  
Instead, it documents **sanitized, domain-specific technical challenges and solutions** encountered in large-scale production environments — intended for technical peers looking for **tangible proof of expertise**.

| # | Title | Summary | Link | Area |
|--:|-------|---------|------|------|
| 1 | 🧠 The Tunnel That Came Up — But Didn’t Work | A real-world debugging journey where an IPsec tunnel came up successfully — but no traffic flowed. A deep dive into strongSwan plugins, Linux kernel ICV mismatch, PF_KEY vs NETLINK, and RFC 4868 alignment. | [Read Story ›]([01_ipsec-tunnel-up-no-traffic/README.md](01_IPsec_Tunnel_up_but_No_traffic)) |  IPsec / Linux Kernel |


*(This will grow over time — one real problem at a time.)*

## 🔍 Why This Repo?

> I'm not just interested in solving tickets — I’m focused on solving **problems**.

Many engineers work in silos, and much of their best work stays buried in internal docs or tribal knowledge. This repo is my attempt to:

- **Document** what I faced and how I fixed it
- Share **debugging thought process**, not just the end result
- Show that not all engineering challenges are about frameworks or APIs — some are deep, silent bugs in production systems
- Offer something real for recruiters, engineering managers, and other senior devs who care about **real-world complexity**

---

## 🧠 Audience

- Engineers who love reading real-world debugging stories  
- Recruiters or hiring managers looking for depth over fluff  
- Folks working with embedded systems, IPsec, Linux internals, or low-level systems design

---

## 🛠️ Structure

Each challenge is in its own folder:

Every entry contains:
- What was the problem
- What didn’t work
- How it was debugged
- The fix or workaround
- Links to RFCs, kernel code, or tools used

---

## 💼 For Hiring Managers

If you’ve landed here via my CV or LinkedIn:

I may not have open source contributions (yet), but these pages reflect the **level of systems thinking, root cause analysis, and production responsibility** I bring every day.

If you want someone who can fix things others can't see — we should talk.
